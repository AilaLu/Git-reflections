How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    //cause all the rest is the same, the probelm can only be detected from the difference of the 2 files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    //most of the time programs are if not 1K or 10K of code. so easy access to history can save you a lot of time looking into the bug

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    //
    manually
    pros: you get to know when you want the changes to be saved
    cons: easily forgotton cause we're humans 

    automatically
    pros: the cons of manually!
    cons: the pros of manually!

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    //one example would be like web design, when you develop html and css, you need to save multiple files in one commit to make sure they are aligned. 
    Google docs usally are individual files, so it's more suitable to saved seperately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    //with git log, all the changes are with an ID, author and time.
    //with git diff, you get to see the changes details between commits, each set of change is in red/green

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    //because I can trace back to the commits from earlier, and know from which commit on the bug is introduced
    You're able to make bald and creative changes because nothing is holding you back:) 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    //I would like to work on my sideproject and make different features and potentitally in different languages.
